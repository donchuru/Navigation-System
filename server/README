Assignment: Trivial Navigation System(Part 2)

Included Files: 
	*wdigraph.h
	*digraph.h
	*digraph.cpp
	*dijkstra.cpp
	*dijkstra.h
	*server.cpp
	*Makefile
	*edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
	*README

Running Instructions:

type "make server" to compile all .cpp files and link them to an executable file.
type "make clean" to remove executable file and object files.

Overview of the files in the solution folder and what they do:

*edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt: Description of Edmonton's road network

*server.cpp: Our route finding server.
It calls readGraph() which reads the Edmonton map data from the provided file and loads it into the WDigraph object passed to this function.
This file also calls dijkstra() which computes the least cost paths that start from a given vertex.

*dijkstra.cpp: contains the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. It uses a min heap.

*dijkstra.h: Header file for Dijkstra's algorithm

*digraph.h, wdigraph,h: Header files for the graphs we make

*Makefile: compiles and links all files into executable called "server"

*README: [meta]


Received help from TAs Gurveer and Hamid. They helped identify subtle bugs
